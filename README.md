# Facial Emotion Recognition using Deep CNN  
A **Deep Learning project** to classify **facial expressions** using **FER2013** and **AffectNet** datasets.  
This model recognizes **7 emotions** (**Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise**) using a **Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

---

## Features  
✔️ **Deep CNN Model** trained on **FER2013 & AffectNet**  
✔️ **Achieved 65.45% Accuracy** on the test set  
✔️ **Uses PyTorch** for training and inference  
✔️ **Confusion Matrix & Loss Curves** for performance analysis  
✔️ **Supports Real-Time Inference** (Webcam support)

## Dataset  
This project uses **two datasets**:  

### FER2013  
- Contains **35,887 grayscale images (48×48)** labeled with **7 emotions**.  

### AffectNet  
- Contains **400,000 images** collected from the internet.  
- **"Contempt" emotion was removed** to match FER2013 labels.

## Results  
**Test Accuracy:** **65.45%**  
**Best Performing Emotion:** **Happy** (**88% Precision, 83% Recall**)  
**Most Confused Emotions:** **Fear & Sad** (often misclassified as **Neutral**)
